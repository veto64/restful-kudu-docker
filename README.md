## What is Kudu?
Kudu is an open source storage engine for structured data which supports low-latency random access together with effi- cient analytical access patterns. Kudu distributes data using horizontal partitioning and replicates each partition using Raft consensus, providing low mean-time-to-recovery and low tail latencies. Kudu is designed within the context of the Hadoop ecosystem and supports many modes of access via tools such as [Cloudera Impala](http://impala.io/), [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/), and [MapReduce](https://hadoop.apache.org/).
